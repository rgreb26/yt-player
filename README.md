### [yt player](https://unrealapex.github.io/yt-player/)

the original youtube player

this branch contains the code for yt player's old ui and javascript code. originally it was concieved on jsfiddle because i was tinkering with ways to make youtube videos load faster on my slow chromebook, but now it has grown into a full blown javascript application! this branch served as the foundation for yt player and also helped me learn a lot about javascript. it is hosted on [codepen](https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/eYLXrMe). for the most current version of yt player, check out the main branch.
